#Questions
  
#What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?
  #I made it through this lesson comfortably, though I couldn't use the default shape settings in part 3 to 
  #map the color gradient. Once I decided to change the shape to 23, I was able to use the fill mapping to 
  #fix the issue, but that led to some frustration. 

#Approximately how long did you work on this lesson?
  # A little over an hour

#What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?
  #I'd like to know why I couldn't set up my plot in part three the same way that you did in the lesson (with the
  #default circle shape)

#What are some things you would like to know more about that is related to, but not covered in, this lesson?
  #I'm all set on this one. It wasn't terribly hard to understand.
