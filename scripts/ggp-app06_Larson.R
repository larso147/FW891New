#### Part 4 - Hiding the Outliers. 

# Option 1 (RGB) - Change the RGB so that the outliers are white -  outlier.color = rgb(red=1, green = 1, blue = 1)
# Option 2 (outlier size) - set outlier size to 0. outlier.size = 0
# Option 3 (outlier alpha) - make the outliers completely transparent - outlier.alpha = 0
# Option 4 - replacement for option 1 - set outlier.shape to NA

#### Questions ####

#Answer the following in comments inside your application script:
  
  # What was your level of comfort with the lesson/application?
      # It took me some time to get through, but I was farily comfortable
      # and only had to "google" the changes to the facet background. 
  # Approximately how long did you work on this lesson?
      # 1.5 hours
  # What areas of the lesson/application confused or still confuses you?
      #Nothing confuses me
  # What are some things you would like to know more about that is related to, but not covered in, this lesson?
      #Can you run individual lm using geom_smooth in each facet grid?
